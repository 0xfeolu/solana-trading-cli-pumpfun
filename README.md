## üö® Set Up 

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps:

### 1. Environment Configuration

1. Locate the template file:
   ```
   src/helpers/.env.example
   ```

2. Copy this file and rename it to `.env` in the same directory.

3. Open the `.env` file and add the following required information:
   - Mainnet wallet secret key (required)
   - RPC endpoint (required)
   - Custom Jito fee (if needed)

4. Optional configurations:
   - Devnet wallet secret key
   - Helius RPC url + key (e.g. getting latest price from dexes)
   - Shyft geyser gRPC token (for grpc trading bots development) (Link to Shyft: https://shyft.to/)

### 2. API Keys and Wallet Setup

- **Solana Wallet**: Ensure you have a funded Solana mainnet wallet. The secret key is required for mainnet transactions.
- **RPC Endpoint**: Obtain a RPC endpoint from reliable node operator like Helius to connect to Solana
- **Jito Integration**: If uses Jito, prepare your custom fee configuration.
- **Shyft Geyser gRPC** (Optional): If you are developing algo trading bot, buy a grpc token from reliable operator like Shyft.

### 3. Final Check

- Confirm that your `.env` file is properly configured and saved.
- Ensure the `.env` file is in the correct location: `src/helpers/.env`
- Verify that you haven't accidentally committed your `.env` file to version control.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Never share or commit your `.env` file or any private keys. The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` for your safety.

For any issues with configuration, please refer to our [Troubleshooting Guide](link-to-troubleshooting) or [open an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name/issues).
